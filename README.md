# wordsy-scorer

A scoring tool for the Wordsy board game. Written in python for practice and fun.

## PLANNING NOTES
The tool should be able to 
* take letters and points as input for scoring
* sum and keep track of scores for a game as a single session
* determine whether a word is lexiconically correct
* attempt to assign "novelty" points
    * this could perhaps use nlp to determine how often a word shows up in vernacular and how erudite it sounds
* perhaps a future endeavour may be to learn javascript as well in order to make this a web application, rather than a cli tool as is currently planned
